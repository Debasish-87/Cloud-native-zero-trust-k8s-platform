✅ GitOps deployment using ArgoCD  
✅ Policy enforcement with Kyverno  
✅ HTML dashboard for scan results  
✅ Extensible pre-commit hook system  
✅ Ready for Zero Trust Kubernetes environments

## 🔧 Security Tools Used

| Tool         | Purpose                                |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Trivy**    | Scan Docker images & IaC for CVEs      |
| **Gitleaks** | Detect hardcoded secrets in source     |
| **Kubeaudit**| Identify insecure K8s configurations   |
| **Kyverno**  | Enforce policies (e.g., block `latest`)|
| **ArgoCD**   | GitOps-based deployment                |

---

## 📁 CI/CD: Jenkinsfile Overview

Your pipeline performs:

- Git change detection
- Trivy version check
- Gitleaks version check
- Kubeaudit version check
- Future-ready to add full scan + auto-alert stages

---

## 💻 HTML Report Dashboard

📂 Path: `html-report/index.html`  
View vulnerabilities, secrets, and misconfigs in one place.  
Easily extend it with charts, summary counts, and filter logic.

---

## 🧪 Pre-Commit Hooks (optional)

Add hooks in `pre-commit-hooks/.pre-commit-config.yaml` to automate:

- Linting
- Secret scans (Gitleaks)
- K8s schema validation
- Trivy config scan

Use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) to enforce these before pushing!

---

## 📜 Sample Kyverno Policies

- ❌ Block use of `latest` image tags  
- ❌ Prevent privilege escalation  
- ✅ Ensure resource limits are defined  
- 🔒 Secure labels/annotations for workloads  

Defined in: `manifests/kyverno-policies/`

---

## 🛡 Future Enhancements 

- Runtime Threat Detection with Falco  
- Istio Service Mesh with mTLS  
- SOAR-based auto responses  
- Prometheus + Grafana Monitoring  
- EFK or Loki-based centralized logging  
- Role-based dashboard & alerts to Teams/Slack
